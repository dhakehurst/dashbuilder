- Data Set Editor
    - Editor's title does not show the current editing data set's name
    - CSV -> File upload not working
    - Test EL provider...
- Data Set Explorer
    - Data sets list -> duplicated several times!pic
- Create new data set
    - Bean -> use cluster metrics
        org.dashbuilder.backend.ClusterMetricsGenerator
        overloadedNodes
        timeFrame 10minute
        aliveNodes server1,server2,server3,server4,serve
    - Remove cpu0 column & save -> bug
    - On data set created -> explorer size calculations = 0 -> bug
- New dashboard
    - Perspective menu items not visible initially, if moving to another perspective and going back to the recent new one just created, they appear on other position
    - Delete dashboard not working (neither in master branch)
- Displayer editor
    - Property editor
        - Displayed incorrectly
        - show overflow-y
- Apps not working
- Optional
    - Only show the BrandLogo for Home and Gallery perspectives (see dashbuilder-webapp/src/main/java/org/dashbuilder/client/ShowcaseEntryPoint.java)
    - Use this opportunity for refactoring Data Set Editor as already done with the Explorer?
- NOTES
    - CAREFUL! -> uf-extensions from uf porcelli's fork (patternfly brach) MUST be compiled before!
